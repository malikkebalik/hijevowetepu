Retrace your steps through the barracks and down the stairs until you reach a closed door in the ruins where you found the Focus gadget.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p></p><p>To return to the second floor, pry open the door ahead of you and proceed through the offices. At the top of the stairs, you'll find a room on your right with a doorway covered by rock formations. Smash the boulders with your spear and grab the power cell from the desk.</p><h3 id=power_cell_02_all_mother_temple class=smooth-goto>Power Cell 02: All-Mother Temple</h3><p>Following The Proving, the next Power Cell may be located in Mother's Watch's All-Mother Temple during the mission The Womb of the Mountain. Following Matriarch Teersa out of the fortress after discovering your equipment and conversing with her, traverse the hall to the closed door.</p><p></p><p>There is an open ventilation duct next to the locked door; enter the room beyond the door and gather a Power Cell by moving through it. The gates to the All-Mother Temple will be temporarily closed after this task is completed. The doors may be locked if you return after finishing The Womb of the Mountain. Don't worry, it'll only be for a short period of time. During the main storyline, Mother's Watch will reopen.</p><p>There's no need to get back in because you won't be able to obtain all five Power Cells before The Mountain That Fell anyhow — but if you're feeling adventurous and don't want to do it the old-fashioned way, there is a way to break through the wall borders at the back of the temple while mounted.</p><p>Simply return as part of The Heart of the Nora objective to re-enter the All-Mother Temple. You won't be able to fast-travel directly to the temple (for reasons you'll soon see), so choose the closest campfire and walk there.</p><h3 id=power_cell_03_makers_end class=smooth-goto>Power Cell 03: Maker’s End</h3><p>The third power cell may be found in Maker's End, which was first discovered during the same-named story quest. You'll want to mount the tower at the east end of the office to the very tip-top of the skyscraper once you've scaled the F.A.S. building all the way up to Faro's Office, which is near the mission's end. Rappel back down after collecting the power cell at the tower's edge. The third power cell may be found in Maker's End, which was first discovered during the same-named story quest.</p><p></p><p>You'll want to mount the tower at the east end of the office to the very tip-top of the skyscraper once you've scaled the F.A.S. building all the way up to Faro's Office, which is near the mission's end.

After you've opened the lock, look on the other side of the door for this power cell, which is laying on the ground.</p><p></p><h3 id=power_cell_05_gaia_prime class=smooth-goto>Power Cell 05: Gaia Prime</h3><p>During The Mountain That Fell, the final power cell is discovered amid the ruins.</p><p>If you try to enter GAIA before this task, you will be able to take out all of the major adversaries and make your way to the door, but you will be unable to do so since vital climbing steps are missing, which will probably be added throughout the main plot.</p><p></p><p>Climb the yellow ladder to enter Sylens' workshop once you arrive here as part of the mission. Speak with Sylens before descending the elevator shaft and rappelling into the ruins.</p><p>Turn left and go north before continuing deeper into the mountain and following your objective marker to the right. Upon the left side of the rock, you'll notice a distinct colored section. Climb up the rubble in front of you and into the blue-lit cave. The final Power Cell is kept on a shelf in the rear room. Once you've collected all five Power Cells, head to the Ancient Armory to receive your gift by solving a series of puzzles.</p><h2 id=horizon_power_cell_locations_guide class=smooth-goto>Horizon Power Cell Locations Guide</h2><p></p><h2 class=smooth-goto>&nbsp;</h2><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
