Chevy Chase cemented himself as a pioneer of the TV comedy world — starring in “Saturday Night Live,” “Community” and the “National Lampoon’s Vacation” film franchise.
However, the 79-year-old comedian has made a reputation for himself for being quite difficult in Hollywood — with several controversies and feuds erupting throughout his career.
“Saturday Night Live” Chase made headlines when he fought with fellow “SNL” member Bill Murray while filming an episode in 1978 and the two came to blows in co-star John Belushi’s dressing room."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And if anybody deserved to be slapped in the forehead it was John, for instigating it all.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Chase was a major player on “Saturday Night Live” from 1975 to 1976. <span class=credit>©NBC/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>On another occasion, while making a guest appearance on the show in 1985, Chase got on Robert Downey Jr.’s nerves by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taking a swipe </a>at his late father.</p><p>The Emmy winner allegedly told the “Iron Man” star: “Didn’t your father used to be a successful director? Whatever happened to him? Boy, he sure died, you know, he sure went to hell.”</p><p>Years later in 2018, he made a highly publicized dig at the sketch comedy series in an interview with the Washington Post.</p><p>“I had to watch a little of it, and I just couldn’t f–king believe it,” Chase said regarding the updated version of the show. “That means a whole generation of s–theads laughs at the worst f–king humor in the world. You know what I mean? How could you dare give that generation worse s–t than they already have in their lives? It just drives me nuts.”</p><p>Pete Davidson, who was a cast member on “SNL” at the time, didn’t mince his words in response while appearing on Howard Stern’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SiriusXM show</a>.</p><p>“He’s a f–king douchebag. F–k Chevy Chase. I hate that dude,” Davidson&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Stern</a>&nbsp;in response to the interview. “He’s just a genuinely bad, racist person, and I don’t like him.” Davidson also defended “SNL” creator&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorne Michaels</a>, saying Chase’s words were “disrespectful to a guy who gave you a career” and that “no matter how big you get, you can’t forget what that guy did for you.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>“Community”</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Danny Pudi (left), Chase, Joel McHaler, Yvette Nicole Brown, Donald Glover, Alison Brie and Gillian Jacobs in “Community.” <span class=credit>NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2009, Chase landed the starring role on NBC’s sitcom, “Community,” portraying millionaire Pierce Hawthorne for five seasons.</p><p>While the show was a step in the right direction for his career, his on-set behavior created drama with castmates.</p><p>One major incident from the show pertained to allegations of racist actions toward co-stars.</p><p>Chase was fired from the show in 2013 after allegedly <a href=#>using a racist slur</a> toward Donald Glover during filming and following<a href=#>&nbsp;a heated confrontation</a>&nbsp;with its creator, Dan Harmon.</p><p>Glover, 40, claimed that Chase<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;used the N-word</a> while on a rant about his issues with his character.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Chase portrayed millionaire Pierce Hawthorne on the series. <span class=credit>©NBC/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>He reportedly used the phrase when he was confused about the dialogue in a scene with the “This Is America” singer and star Yvette Nicole Brown.</p><p>In 2018, the “Atlanta” actor and Harmon opened up to the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;New Yorker</a>&nbsp;about Chase’s inappropriate conduct.</p><p>“Chevy was the first to realize how immensely gifted Donald was, and the way he expressed his jealousy was to try to throw Donald off,”&nbsp;Harmon said at the time. “I remember apologizing to Donald after a particularly rough night of Chevy’s non-PC verbiage, and Donald said, ‘I don’t even worry about it.’”</p><p>Glover chimed in: “I just saw Chevy as fighting time — a true artist has to be OK with his reign being over. I can’t help him if he’s thrashing in the water. But I know there’s a human in there somewhere — he’s almost too human.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Glover (right) claimed that Chase called him a racist slur on “Community.”</figure><p>The “Hot Tub Time Machine” star didn’t deny using the racist insult during an&nbsp;interview with the <a href=#>Washington Post&nbsp;</a>later that same year.&nbsp;</p><p>“I could have said it,” he told the publication, before noting it would have been misinterpreted. He then added that he had been a fan of Glover’s the entire time they worked together on “Community” and denied that he was a bigot.</p><p>Chase recently expressed his hatred of the show, telling Marc Maron on his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“WTF”&nbsp;podcast</a>&nbsp;that “Community” <a href=#>wasn’t “funny enough” for him</a>.</p><p>“I felt a little bit constrained a bit. Everyone had their bits and stuff. I thought they were all good, but it just wasn’t hard-hitting enough for me,” he said.</p><p><a href=#>The “Community” cast is set to reunite for a movie,</a> but it’s unlikely that Chase will be a part of the project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma29fmLWmwthmmqGZo5rAbq7IoJ6eq6Ris6bBw6xkn6qfonqku8ymrKehpK56tbuMrKWlZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
