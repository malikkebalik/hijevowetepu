Rebrov acknowledged past mistakes but emphasized their determination to perform better this time around.</p><p>‘It is one thing to play against North Macedonia or Malta, with respect, but when we play England or Italy, it is different,’ Rebrov remarked. ‘This is a game when we have to show our face.
