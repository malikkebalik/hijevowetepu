Kelley</h2><p>During her appearance on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Kimmel in 2022, Michelle Pfeiffer spoke about how she was hesitant to meet David E. Kelley at first.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was kind of nervous,” she recalled. “And I’d had a couple of bad blind dates and I had sworn off of them.”</p><p>However, Michelle Pfeiffer’s best friend convinced her to go for it. “[They’] said, ‘’Please, just this last time, meet this guy, David Kelley,’ and I said, ‘OK.’”</p><p>Pfeiffer also said she thought Kelley and her sister, Dedee Pfeiffer, were a better match. She had noticed the duo had a chat during a dinner prior to the bowling party. “We all met for dinner before, which was the awkward part, probably,” she continued. “&nbsp;think the bowling part was OK. Somehow, he ended up sitting across from my sister and I ended up sitting across from his best friend.”</p><p>Michelle Pfeiffer described her sister as being very charming and really good socially. She, on the other hand, is the opposite. “I’m not so good. And he’s a little bit shy, we’re both a little bit [shy]. I say to my best friend ‘I think I should set Dedee up with him. They seem to be really hitting it off.’”</p><p>Her best friend refused to allow her to set Kelley up with her sister. “My friend said, ‘Don’t you dare. I will kill you. I am sitting across from your next husband.’”</p><p>It seemed as though her best friend was correct and the duo ended up together after all.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminlKS6psDEq2Wcp51kvaa7z6WcaJqRqbqiuoyrnK2toqPAbr%2FTmqlmpZmYtaa4y55kqZ6VnrOnsdFmmp6klZe%2FosDErGRsaF2usqK%2B0mamn2WSoba0v4ywoK2gXZ2ys3nHrqqbmZ6ZeqWt1aKbZp1doLKtuMSyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
