She also starred in VH1’s The Price of Beauty in 2010. She even went into film starring in films like The Dukes of Hazzard and Employee of the Month. As an entrepreneur, she has launched her own line of hair and beauty products, designed fragrances, shoes, and handbags. Her line became the Jessica Simpson Collection, which launched in 2005.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Jessica’s foray into pop music made her a star, but her televised marriage to then-husband Nick Lachey propelled her to the A-List. She played the dumb blonde perfectly, but we know it must have been a ruse, as Jessica’s business instincts have been dead on – with her collection earning close to a billion dollars.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Jessica married Nick Lachey on TV, then let the cameras follow their relationship, which led to its demise. She then famously dated Tony Romo for what seemed like forever, before he dumped her and married Candace Crawford. But she rebounded quickly with Eric Johnson — the pair got engaged in November 2010 and have had two children together, Maxwell (born in May 2012) and Ace (born in June 2013).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3yrsdKsoJyZXai2rrzSqKVocF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
