She attends his Rise Nation classes regularly. These are 30-minute classes that can help you get fit by using a VersaClimber machine. You will get a total body workout that will burn off many calories at once. The diva says that as the duration of these workouts is just 30-minutes, she easily gets motivated to do it. Ashley also likes the atmosphere of the class. The loud music makes her feel like she is training in a club.</p><figure id=attachment_50414 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-50414 style=width:495px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Ashley Greene during a 30 Minute workout</figure><h3><strong>Other Workouts</strong></h3><p>Apart from the 30-minute workouts, the hazel-eyed beauty is also a fan of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>yoga</a> and hiking. She has been using Jason as her personal trainer since last three years. She visits Rise Nation at least 3 days every week. Whenever Greene does the special 30-minute workout, she always tries to follow it up by a cool down on branded Trigger Point foam rollers and Muscle Milk yoga mats. They supposedly do it on the Nation’s patio space overlooking the Hollywood Hills skyline.</p><figure id=attachment_50415 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-50415 style=width:596px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Ashley Greene yoga workout</figure><h3><strong>Getting Back in Shape</strong></h3><p>Ash also admits that when she is feeling out of shape (we doubt if it actually happens), she likes to get her body back only at Rise Nation. She says that it’s a surefire way to get back in shape when a person has taken a break.</p><h3><strong>Workout with Others</strong></h3><p>The brunette loves to workout with other people. She is currently working out with a group of 6 to 8 people. Ashley&nbsp;says that working out with them makes her feel that exercise&nbsp;is fun and a positive activity. She would prefer working out with people rather than going out and eating with them.</p><h3><strong>Diet Secret</strong></h3><p>The biggest diet secret of the film star is that she is very cool about what she eats. She eats whatever she wants and follows the rule of moderation. As per this rule, a person can eat anything, even donuts and chocolates if he or she just has a small piece of it. Ashley&nbsp;has given so much freedom to herself because she likes being physically active and knows that she would burn all those extra calories quickly. She also adds that this diet secret is working perfectly for her because she remains pretty healthy almost all the time.</p><figure id=attachment_50412 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-50412 style=width:592px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Ashley Greene after a workout session</figure><h3><strong>Love for Pizza</strong></h3><p>When the Rogue (2013-Present) actress is in New York, she just can’t resist a pizza. She is a fan of John’s Pizzeria on Bleecker and says that it’s very delicious. She even admits that she can easily eat half of that pizza at once because it’s that good. She calls it worth the extra effort too. We suppose she means that after having the pizza, she heads to the gym to work off the calories. Asher is also a fan of the Cheez-It. It’s the only snack she loves a lot and keeps them in the house because she absolutely loves to have it when she wants.</p><figure id=attachment_50416 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-50416 style=width:495px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Trainer Jason Walsh during his 30-minute workout</figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpqqoaSVrnqovsSepZ5lY2V6rrXNrqueZaekv6y71K1kn6Gko7K0v4ysnJyqlanAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
