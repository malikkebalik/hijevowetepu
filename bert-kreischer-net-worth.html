He has also participated in numerous Comedy Central shows, and all of his endeavors have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Bert Kreischer? As of late-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $1 million, mostly earned through television and stand-up comedy work. Other shows he’s hosted include “Bert the Conquerer” and the podcast “Bertcast”. He’s also made numerous guest appearances and as he continues his career which already spans 20 years, it is expected that his wealth will increase.</p><h3>Bert Kreischer Net Worth $1 million</h3><p>Bert started earning popularity while at college, being featured in a Rolling Stone article as “the top partier” from “the top party school in the US”, Florida State University. It was reported that the article was for inspiration for the film “Van Wilder”. He then started appearing regularly on television after establishing himself as a stand-up comedian. He became the co-host of the variety show “The X Show” from 2000 to 2001, and his popularity in the show led to his own show entitled “Hurt Bert” in 2004, and he also made a guest appearance in the drama “The Shield”. His net worth was established.</p><p>Since then, he’s made regular appearances on the radio and in podcasts, which include the “Joe Rogan Experience”, “Opie and Anthony”, WMMR’s “Preston and Steve”, and “The Todd and Tyler Radio Empire”. During his performances on radio, one of his most famous stories is that he claims to have drunk with the Russian Mob while on a college field trip to Russia, and even (allegedly) participated in a robbery while being intoxicated. Aside from these guest appearances, Bert continued doing stand-up routines, with most of them utilised for the Comedy Central animated series “Shorties Watchin’ Shorties”.</p><p>In 2008, he became a part of the Comedy Central reality show “Reality Bites Back”, in which contestants competed in parodies of other reality shows. The following year, he had a comedy special released entitled “Bert Kreisher: Comfortably Dumb”, then in 2010 he became the host of “Bert the Conqueror”, in which he travels to various entertainment venues and amusement parks around the United States, promoting various unusual sports, roller coasters, and water rides. The following year he appeared as a guest on the “Joe Rogan Experience” mentioning that the “Van Wilder” movie was originally a movie based on his own life which was worked on with <a href=#>Oliver Stone</a>. However, the deal fell apart but one of the writers retained intellectual rights to the work. He changed the name and sold the script to the movie which would eventually become “Van Wilder”. His net worth was still rising.</p><p>In 2014, Bert released the book “Life of the Party: Stories of a Perpetual Man-Child”, and one of his latest projects is the weekly comedy podcast “Bertcast”, which is part of the All Things Comedy network.</p><p>For his personal life, Kreischer is married to LeAnn Kemp.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=15.533898305085><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Bert Kreischer</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 3, 1972</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Tampa, Florida, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.82 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Comedian</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Florida State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>LeAnn Kreischer</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Gege Kreischer, Al Kreischer</td></tr><tr readability=0.34782608695652><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/BertKreischer</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/bertkreischer</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38297872340426><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/bertkreischer</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0470679/</a></td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Movies</td><td>Bert Kreischer: Comfortably Dumb, Alpha Mail, Boston, MA, United States, Spokane, WA, United States, Columbus, OH, United States</td></tr><tr readability=15><td>TV Shows</td><td>Reality Bites Back, Bert the Conqueror, The X Show, Cinderella Story, Boston, MA, United States, Spokane, WA, United States, Columbus, OH, United States</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Member of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity, Florida State University</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypictures.org/thumbs/0470679/0470679_1.jpeg><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Alpha Mail</td><td>2007</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Best in Town</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Documentary Host</td></tr><tr><td>The Shield</td><td>2004</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Alfred</td></tr><tr><td>Prepare to Meet Thy God</td><td>2001</td><td>Short</td><td>Mr. Rekcor</td></tr><tr><td>Life with David J</td><td>2001</td><td>TV Movie</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Bert Kreischer: Comfortably Dumb</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Special executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Hurt Bert</td><td>2005</td><td>TV Movie executive producer</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Thanks <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=thanks readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Tom Segura: Completely Normal</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Special special thanks</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=15><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Ear Buds: The Podcasting Documentary</td><td>2016</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Bert the Conqueror</td><td>2010-2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself -
