Psalm then joins in again and they both look at the camera with confidence. It was a cute and memorable moment that many fans loved!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">“Chi has a beautiful voice! She is going to be a superstar when she’s older!” one fan wrote in the comments section while another called the duo “the cutest.” A third called Chicago Kim’s “twin” and shared, “The way her brother was really paying attention and listening. Those two are going to be extremely close as adult siblings. Mark my words. That big sister little brother sh*t is real.

The rapper wore his controversial <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“White Lives Matter” shirt</a> from his clothing line as he sat on the sidelines to watch the nine-year-old on the court. Kim was sitting in one of the seats a bit away from him and it’s unclear if the exes talked to each other at the game.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kanye’s appearance at the game happened just a few days after he wore the same shirt during a surprise appearance at an event for Paris Fashion Week. It brought on a lot of opinions on social media and led to a lot of online feuds between the “Jesus Walks” crooner and people like Vogue editor, <strong>Gabriella Karefa-Johnson</strong> and <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong>. He also went on a series of rants <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on Instagram</a>, which led to him being restricted on the app and had one of his messages deleted off the platform after it was criticized for using <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>anti-Semitic language</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49yZpygmZiuqLuMsJysrF2grq%2FFxGarq62VYrmwwsRmmqiqopqwtb%2BMm6morJiav2680pqjpmWcrr%2Bqr9JmraKclaR8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
