Katherine’s career started in 2000.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Katherine Moennig is, as of mid- 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Moennig’s net worth is as high as $2 million, an amount earned through her successful career in the entertainment industry as an actress. Apart from film and television roles, Katherine has also appeared on stage in such productions as “As You Like It”, “Love Letters”, “Lovers”, and “Anna K”, among others, which have also improved her wealth.</p><h3>Katherine Moennig Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>Katherine is the daughter of Mary Zahn, a Broadway dancer, and William H. Moennig. Her father is the half-brother of Blythe Danner, who is Bruce Paltrow’s widow, therefore, Katherine is related to actress <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, and director and producer Jake Paltrow.</p><p>Katherine was a tomboy in her childhood days and was often spotted with only boys during her growing up. Thanks to her male looks she later received gender-bending roles, such is her most prominent role to date as Shane McCutcheson. After high school, Katherine moved to New York and enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and then in 2000 made her screen debut in the role of Jacqueline “Jake” Pratt, a girl that dresses as a boy, in the TV drama series “Young Americans”. She spent the early 2000s building her name with roles in such films as the romantic drama “Love the Hard Way” (2001), among others, while in 2004 she was given the role of Shane McCutcheson, which put her on the Hollywood map, but also her net worth was increasing.</p><p>The series lasted until 2009, and Katherine didn’t have many notable roles while the show lasted, instead, in 2009 she portrayed Jilly in the Golden Globe Award- nominated drama “Everybody’s Fine”, starring <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a>, <a href=#>Kate Beckinsale</a> and <a href=#>Sam Rockwell</a>. The same year she also cast in the part of Dr. Miranda Foster in the TV drama series “Three Rivers” (2009-2010). In 2013 she was selected for the role of Lena, Ray Donovan’s assistant, in the series of the same name, with the main character played by Live Schreiber. This also added a significant amount to her net worth.</p><p>Most recently, she starred in the biographical drama “Lane 1974” (2017).</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Katherine is a lesbian, and so far has been in several high-profile relationships, which have included actress <a href=#>Evan Rachel Wood</a>, and singer-songwriter Holy Miranda.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=15.123287671233><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Katherine Moennig</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 29, 1977</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 8" (1.73 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>American Academy of Dramatic Arts</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>William Moennig, Mary Zahn</td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/katemoennig</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.375><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/kateomoennig/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0595485/</a></td></tr><tr readability=16><td>Movies</td><td>The L Word, Ray Donovan, Everybody's Fine, The Lincoln Lawyer, Love the Hard Way, Young Americans, Art School Confidential, Invitation to a Suicide, Three Rivers, Default, My Dead Boyfriend, Gone, Slo-Mo</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>Three Rivers, The L Word, Young Americans, Ray Donovan</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Black hair</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Frequently plays androgynous characters</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Deep, husky voice</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=1.8712446351931><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3.7356828193833><td>1</td><td>[on what she's learned from playing the role of Jake Pratt on <a href=#>Young Americans</a> (2000)] "The clothes are comfortable...but on a deeper level I learned that the competition between boys and girls isn't as strong as between women"</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=23.860555196901><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3.5060975609756><td>1</td><td>Was roommates with <a href=#>Leisha Hailey</a> and <a href=#>Mia Kirshner</a> while filming <a href=#>The L Word</a> (2004).
