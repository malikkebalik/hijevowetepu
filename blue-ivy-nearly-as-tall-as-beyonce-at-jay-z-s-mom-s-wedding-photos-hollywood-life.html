Beyonce completed the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pretty in pink</a> look with open-toed heels, droplet earrings, and sunglasses. The 41-year-old even added a pink purse complete with a heart fit for the romantic occasion. Meanwhile, Blue looked chic in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>silky green gown</a> and purple mini-high heels. The preteen tied her raven-hued tresses back in a low ponytail and accessorized with droplet earrings and a silver necklace.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Both Beyonce and her little one were accompanied by the singer’s mom,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tina Knowles</strong></a>, 69. While making her way to toward Tribeca 360 in Manhattan with her family, Tina twinned with Bey and opted for a blush pink gown. The proud grandmother completed the ensemble with a white shawl and opted for flats for the wedding. Soon after photos of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Beyonce and Blue</a> landed on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media</a>, many of the Grammy winner’s fans took to the comments to gush over their looks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blue-Ivy-Beyonce-Wedding-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Beyoncé was so forreal when she said Blue Ivy was gonna be litty and have vintage pieces by the time she hit the city—she looks so adorable,” one admirer tweeted, while another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>replied</a>, “She’s almost <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>as tall as her mom</a>.” Meanwhile, a third fan couldn’t help but admire the relationship that the 11-year-old and her momma seem to have. “I just love seeing the beautiful relationship between mother and daughter. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Blue Ivy and Beyoncé</a> seem to have such a loving relationship, and also it’s very nice to see a parent supporting their child and being present for their child,” they <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gushed</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>This is not the first time that Blue has made headlines this year either, as many have been impressed at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her performances</a> during her mom’s world tour. Since her mom kicked off the highly-anticipated concerts, her eldest child has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been dancing</a> alongside Bey’s backup dancers and wowing the crowds. Many <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>videos</a> of Blue dancing on stage have since gone viral with the BeyHive praising her for her moves. “I loooove [sic] how each show she got more confident in herself,” one fan <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>, while another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>joked</a>, “The THRONE is secured.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The proud <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother-of-three</a> even took to Instagram on May 29 to gush over her daughter’s latest dancing performances. “My beautiful first born I’m so proud and thankful to be your mama. You bring us so much joy, my sweet angel,” Beyonce captioned the carousel of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos and videos</a> of Blue. Beyonce and Jay-Z welcomed Blue about four years after they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married</a> in 2008. Later, in 2017, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Beyonce’s twins</a> <strong>Rumi and Sir&nbsp;</strong>were born.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49sZpukpZp6qsLYZquapJxir6bFzqeanmWalsZuxoympqZlp5qxpbXNoGSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
