The two often work together and make for a great team! Here is everything you need to know about Tana.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gordon-Ramsay-and-Tana-Ramsay-shutter-embed-1.jpg><h2><strong>How Did Gordon And Tana Meet?</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Born&nbsp;<strong>Cayetana Elizabeth Hutchenson,</strong> Tana grew up on a family farm in the English country, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a>. As a young adult, Tana moved to London to become a Montessori teacher. She first met Gordon at a New Year’s Eve party, while she was engaged to another man, and she was less than impressed by the future culinary superstar. She later met him again, when he stored a motorcycle at a flat she lived in with a friend, and that’s when the romance started.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Of course, the life of a chef can often be difficult. Working in a restaurant, the cooks often work long hours and won’t get home until very late at night or early the next morning. When the couple started dating, Tana had to wait out long hours to see Gordon, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Delish</a>. Even though it consisted of many late nights, Tana kept up for him, and the pair got married in December 1996, when Tana was 21.</p><h2><strong>Tana And Gordon Have Five Kids</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Tana struggled to have children early on in her marriage to Gordon. She was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, which affected her fertility and made it harder for her to have children, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>DailyMail</a>. After hardships, she turned to IVF to try to have a child, and it worked out great for the couple! The couple now have five children&nbsp;<strong>Megan,&nbsp;</strong>23, twins&nbsp;<strong>Holly&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Jack,&nbsp;</strong>21,&nbsp;<strong>Matilda,&nbsp;</strong>19, and&nbsp;<strong>Oscar,&nbsp;</strong>2.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Even though they have lovely family, the couple have had issues with pregnancy, even in recent years. In 2016, Tana suffered a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>miscarriage</a>, when she was 5 months pregnant. Despite having to go through something so upsetting, Tana said that her husband helped her. “You go from having a baby kicking inside of you to suddenly it’s not there, and it was a really hard experience,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Metro</a>&nbsp;in 2020. “Gordon was amazing, and he’s always been one to talk about everything and he was very good at sort of talking it out of me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gordon-Ramsay-and-Tana-Ramsay-shutter-embed-2.jpg><h2><strong>Tana Is A Cookbook Author</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Gordon isn’t the only one who knows his way around the kitchen in his marriage! Even though her celebrity chef husband is well-known for his culinary abilities, Tana has authored five cookbooks of her own. The recipes in her books focus mostly on practical home cooking. Her books are: Tana’s Kitchen Secrets,&nbsp;I Love to Bake, Tana Ramsay’s Family Kitchen, Home Made,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tana Ramsay’s Real Family Food. “I wanted to simplify everything. The recipes come from me, friends and family. I was determined it should be real,” she said in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a> about her approach to the cookbooks.</p><h2><strong>Tana Has Been On A Few TV Shows</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>While her husband is a full-blown TV chef, Tana has made a few appearances of her own. She’s appeared on her husband’s many shows, including&nbsp;Hell’s Kitchen&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Masterchef</a> USA. She also had a part in her daughter Matilda’s reality-series&nbsp;Matilda and The Ramsay Bunch. Perhaps most notably, she was also a part of the British reality competition show&nbsp;Dancing on Ice&nbsp;in 2010. She was partnered with&nbsp;<strong>Stuart Widdall</strong>, but unfortunately, she was eliminated in the fourth round.</p><h2><strong>Tana Is Friends With Victoria Beckham</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Tana and Gordon are close friends with fellow celebrities&nbsp;<strong>David&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Victoria Beckham</strong>. Both couples look like they get their families together whenever they can and are great friends. Victoria has posted photos plenty of times when their families have had joint outings. She shared<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a picture</a> of her daughter <strong>Harper&nbsp;</strong>giving Oscar a kiss on his cheek in August 2020. She posted a<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> picture of both families</a> getting together to celebrate Tana’s birthday in 2018. Gordon has joked about his close relationship with the Beckhams. “Three girls and a boy, and three boys and a girl – you’d be amazed at the synergy. We’ve promised that no one dates anybody,” he said in a 2017 interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;The Sun</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8aoqZ2nnmK%2FornSmrBmr5mbsm6Ak3FpbW1mZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
