With his gravelly voice singing his deep original tracks, he had made it into the final five contestants of the globally renowned singing show.
However, he had to head back home in May, not because his vocals didn't make the cut, but because of a controversial social media post he had made when he was 12."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He has also been writing songs about his experiences on <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Idol.&nbsp;</p><p>It was undoubtedly hard on the teen singer to have left American Idol the way he did, that too just two performances away from the finals.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Still, his parents have been at his corner, supporting him through the entire ordeal.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>His Supportive Parents</h2><p>In a Facebook post from May 14, 2021, his father, Mark Kennedy, who had a front-row seat while Caleb performed on Idol,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">updated</a> his profile picture to a photo of the young songster with a frame that read, "I stand with Caleb Kennedy. Caleb Strong."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Following suit, his mom, Anita Guy,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded</a> a profile picture with the same frame. Even his stepfather <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">put up</a> a snap of himself on&nbsp;Facebook to reflect the same text.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Almost immediately after the news of Caleb's elimination had been made public, Anita got in touch with the Herald-Journal to clarify the three-second clip that had thrown her son to the wolves.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>It Was Not What It Looked Like</h2><p>The video in question was a Snapchat clip of the Idol alum leaning against a wooden panel while someone who appeared to be wearing the Ku Klux Klan hood sat down beside him and posed for the camera.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>According to the mother, the happenings of that day were&nbsp;not at all what they looked like.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, the hooded figure was not a white supremacist. Instead, it was a costume inspired by the movie The Strangers: Prey at Night. The movie had amassed a fandom at the time, and Caleb just happened to be one such fan.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The doting mother did acknowledge what it looked like and assured the publication that her son did not "have a racist bone in his body." She further explained that Caleb had friends of all races and loved all of them indiscriminately.&nbsp;</p><h2>Caleb's Apology</h2><p>Caleb, however, decided to be the bigger man and took responsibility for his acts, regardless of the act being a mistake of his 12-year-old self.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>His Instagram apology reaffirmed that the contents of the video were not what it seemed like, but considering that he has let down his fans, he thought an apology was owed nevertheless.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>His apology ended on a positive note though. He still had hopes of earning the trust and respect that he had lost because of the controversy, and he was thankful to people who stood in support.&nbsp;</p><p>In a more recent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">statement</a>, Caleb revealed that he did not regret going on American Idol. On the contrary, he actually loved the experience.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5iurbHBZqKepp6asbp5z5qpnqakqHquu8xmm5qcXp3Brrg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
