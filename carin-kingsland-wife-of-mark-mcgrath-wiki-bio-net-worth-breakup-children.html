The pair began dating soon after and faced a series of hardships during the early years of the relationship. However, both Mark and Carin persevered and went on to date for 18 years before tying the knot. They walked down the aisle in a private wedding ceremony on September 24, 2012, in Southern California attended by their close friends and family. Mark revealed the news to People Magazine following the marriage, recounting all the moments of happiness and despair the pair spent together.</p><p>“After 18 years of breakups, makeups, beautiful twins and an unwavering love that provided some pretty damn good song lyrics, we are happy to announce that we are finally married.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Loving Wife and Mother</h2><p>Carin has twins with Mark and the pair are absolutely in love with their kids.

We did the IVF thing. It was intense and expensive, but we did it in one shot and, boom, here they are. My job now is to be the best parent I can be because that is all that matters.”</p><p>While Mark mentioned that he had a lot to learn about parenting, he was full of praise for Carin who was already the perfect mother.

Talking about their marriage, Carin told The Agency,</p><p>“Without the kids, we like to go catch a movie at the ArcLight. They have adult theaters there so I can have a glass of wine and unwind!
