He had a tough time overcoming his addiction.&nbsp;The mental, spiritual, and physical aspects of Earle’s being were all consumed by his relentless fight against addiction.</p><p>His death was the result of that struggle. He spent his entire life fighting for addiction treatment, despite the difficulties he encountered in his own life. Together with his mom, Ma Van, he started the nonprofit Hope on Deck. Many people, each on their own road to recovery, benefited greatly from his consistent efforts.&nbsp;Standing at 6 feet 6 inches and covered in a large number of tattoos, he was a notorious character in Philadelphia’s most notorious drug areas.&nbsp;His life’s story allowed him to relate to people going through tough times and give them hope and a path to recovery.</p><p>He had a profound impact on the recovery community, where his radiant spirit touched the lives of many.&nbsp;His acts of compassion extended to those experiencing homelessness as much as they did to those battling addiction. There were no limits to his generosity and selflessness.&nbsp;Earle persisted in his fight against addiction despite overwhelming odds, and his efforts paid off in a way that nobody had foreseen.&nbsp;When he is finally released from the pain that had imprisoned him, his loved ones can take solace in the fact that he is finally at peace.</p><p>An example of how addiction knows no bounds, the community has lost a great member in Earle’s sudden departure.&nbsp;But the countless lives he touched will carry his memory with them into the future.&nbsp;His infectious smile, along with the comforting glow of his light, will stay with us forever.&nbsp;As we remember Earle, let us not forget his unwavering dedication to the well-being of others, his compassion, and his doggedness in the battle against addiction.</p><p>The example he sets through his life should motivate us to be less selfish, more caring, and steadfast in our commitment to improving the world. Earle Van has left an indelible mark on the recovery community and beyond; yet, his impact will live on long after his passing. Ma Van, his children, and all those who knew and loved him are here with you in our prayers and thoughts.&nbsp;Earle Van, I hope you have a peaceful rest. Many will find hope in your lasting impact, and we will follow in your footsteps because of the light you have given us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmanBrbHHqKysnV6asbZ61admnpmiobJuwsCnZKiamanCor7YZpuepJGsrrOxjKaYp2WUnrKlecCfq56qXZZ6qL7UnqOippdifnZ52J6Yq2WSlsG1uMRmrqKsmGKupbDInKuip55isaat06FkraCVYsSwvsudZKiamanAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
