Eva is a Swedish national who was born in Nyhammar, a small town near Stockholm. While it remains a mystery as to how they met in the first place, they have stories to tell.</p><p>Rudy decided to trade in his whistle for cleats after meeting his wife Eva, and he took the opportunity to play for a fourth-division team. Eva was an assistant soccer coach at the University of Hartford at the time. She was a university coach for six years. Rudy mentioned,</p><p>“After we met, I went to Sweden with her and realized as a soccer player that I had been robbed of my soccer experience growing up in America,” she says.</p><p>Eva encouraged Rudy to play and suggested he look into the local team. However, things did not go as planned.</p><p>She was also the head coach of Wesleyan’s soccer team. In 2020, Eva will begin her 17th season.
