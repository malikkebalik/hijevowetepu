[T]hat’s how long I’ve remained composed, silent, and have patiently waited on the Lord. 35,856 hours of my life that I have wept with reverence for Him as I kept hearing ‘do not speak up yet’ as I sat wayside while strangers on the internet slandered, harassed, defamed, stalked, and destroyed my reputation.”</p><p>Davis added that though she has “remained silent” while social media users “invent narratives” about her and “come after” her home, family, and life, “they have no idea who they’re messing with.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Texas social media influencer, Brittany Dawn Davis, who is&nbsp;accused of scamming clients through her online fitness and nutrition program is now facing trial in Dallas. <span class=credit>Instagram/ @RealBrittanyDawn</span></figure><p>“[T]here is a fire building within my heart – like a lion roaring on the inside of me,” she wrote. “[I]f you think you’ll never be found behind an anonymous account and be held accountable for damages, threats, defamation, and slander… think again. Christians might be gentle, but we are not soft.”</p><p><a href=#>The&nbsp;lawsuit filed against Davis&nbsp;and her fitness company</a> alleges Davis did not deliver on the personalized fitness packages, coaching, and check-ins that she promised those who purchased one of her plans.</p><p>“Beginning in 2014, <a href=#>Defendants profited from the sale of online fitness packages</a> to thousands of consumers with the promise of personalized nutritional guidance and individualized fitness coaching. Specifically, Defendants’ online fitness packages offered ‘macro’ nutritional assessments and, depending on the plan purchased, daily or weekly email training and one-on-one coaching. Defendants’ online nutrition and fitness packages ranged from $92.00 for one-time macro consultation to $300.00 for three months of personalized macros, training, and coaching,” the complaint against Davis states.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The fitness influencer is accused of misleading clients who signed up to receive her customized fitness and nutrition packages. <span class=credit>Instagram/ @RealBrittanyDawn</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The lawsuit alleges Davis did not deliver on the personalized fitness packages, coaching, and check-ins that she promised. <span class=credit>U.S. District Court</span></figure><p>But the packages for clients “were not individualized,” plaintiffs allege, and Dawn “failed to provide the promised coaching and check-ins” to her clients.&nbsp;</p><p>“Defendants largely ignored consumer complaints or, if they did respond, offered only partial refunds. In 2019, consumers’ complaints on social media garnered media attention prompting Defendant Davis to make a video apology posted to YouTube. Defendants promptly took the website down,” the lawsuit says.</p><p>Her trial was scheduled to begin on March 6 but was postponed indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“[M]y time to fight back is here,” the influencer wrote on her social media page. <span class=credit>Instagram/ @RealBrittanyDawn</span></figure><p>Meanwhile, Davis has embarked on a new entrepreneurial journey as the founder of She Lives Freed – a team of 14 women who organize women’s faith retreats that cost $600 per person.</p><p>“She Lives Freed&nbsp;was founded by Brittany Dawn after the Lord radically changed her life in 2019, from darkness to light. Her mission is to share the gospel of Jesus, cultivate a community of sisters, and walk alongside women into freedom through the love of our Savior,” the She Lives Freed website states.</p><p>The first women’s retreat took place in Austin in January 2021. Since then, the organization has hosted five more retreats, with the next taking place in Oklahoma, according to the website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmamxfm7a1usSsqmahnpu5trHNnJyrZZKntrXAwKewZpyRrLturcKcrKydlGK8p3nSnJimpZmjtG6vy6Kcp6yjYsOww9Jmq6hllp60qcCMm5ico18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
