Kim was discovered dead at the young age of 47 years last Thursday and Diddy broke his silence on his baby mama's death and wrote, "For the last three days I’ve been trying to wake up out of this nightmare. But I haven’t. I don’t know what I’m going to do without you baby. I miss you so much. Today I’m going to pay tribute to you, I’m going to try and find the words to explain our unexplainable relationship. We were more than best friends, we were more than soulmates. WE WERE SOME OTHER S—!! And I miss you so much. Super Black Love."</p><p>Following this, Diddy's other exes too paid tributes to the departed Kim in heartfelt messages.</p><p>Misa Hylton Brim, who has 24-year-old son Justin with Diddy, shared a tear-jerking note where she thanked Kim for always "being a 2nd mother" to her son. She posted a picture of Kim smiling and wrote, "Kim Kim Kim for the last 20 years we have raised our children together, my mind cannot begin to wrap around the fact that you are not going to be here. Thank you for being a 2nd mother to Justin and for loving Niko and Madison just the same."</p><p>"This is one of the most shocking and painful experiences that I have ever been through. A devastating loss to our family. Not that long ago we had a dope conversation about the kids and how proud we were of them all. We spoke about their futures and how we could come together to support them in business. That was a very special conversation. But you were cool like that, and that is what I will miss the most. Our inside jokes and the fact that we have an unspoken understanding around what it was like to raise our children in this life," she continued.&nbsp;</p><p>"I promise to love and protect Quincy, Chris, D’lila and Jessie. I will always be here for them.&nbsp;Rest in Power Beautiful Queen. Please continue to pray for us," she concluded and also thanked "everyone for your prayers and comforting words."</p><p>Diddy also has a daughter 12-year-old Chance with Sarah Chapman, who also shared an emotional tribute to Kim. She posted a picture of Porter and her children - 27-year-old Quincy, 20-year-old Christian, and also 11-year-old twin girls D’Lila Star and Jessie James -- and shared, "Rest in paradise Kim, and know your kids are covered in prayer and love. Your light will always shine thru your children and the way they all love each other is a blessing beyond words."</p><p>Diddy's former girlfriend Cassie, who broke up with the star in September after a long relationship, also mourned the death of Porter. "There are no words….An amazing mother to her beautiful family, lit up every room she entered and now the most beautiful angel," she wrote.</p><p>"Sending so much love and my condolences to the Porter and Combs family. I love you @quincy, @kingcombs, Jessie, D’Lila, Chance, @princejdc and @diddy. Puff you are already the best father, I know you will be amazing," she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonJmZsbp5wqikm6tdmsWmv4ymoKyZXZ3GrcDOp2SbqpmierSt0ZqfZpuYlr2urc1mmpqro56ybsDRopmurJViwbB5yqKkZqifp8Gmvg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
