Or Is He Gay?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-09-01</div><p><strong>Murray Bartlett is an Australian actor best known for his appearances in Sex And The City, The White Lotus, Welcome To Chippendales, and The Last Of Us. Bartlett just received an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Role for his role as Armond, a hotel manager in the HBO anthology comedy series White Lotus.</strong></p><p>One thing that Bartlett’s roles have in common is that the actor has played a gay character several times. Murray has played a few LGBT roles, thus many people have speculated if he is a nonbinary star. After all, when it comes to gay sex, he has repeatedly created history. Bartlett is, in fact, gay and has always been upfront about it. However, the 51-year-old actor is very private about his relationship, and one could argue that he has successfully kept that aspect of his life out of the spotlight. Murray does, however, have a partner, as various media outlets have reported.</p><p>While media sources say Murray has a partner, the question of who has captured Bartlett’s heart remains unanswered. The answer is still unknown, with speculation rife as to the identity of this mysterious partner. Have they come out into the open, or will their love stay a secret? Read what the subheadings have to say about these enticing questions.</p><h2><span id=Murray_Bartlett_does_not_have_a_wife_and_instead_has_a_boyfriend>Murray Bartlett does not have a wife and instead has a boyfriend.</span></h2><p>Murray, as previously stated, is not married but is in a same-sex relationship with his lover, whose name appears to be Matt. However, little further is known about Bartlett’s mystery accomplice.</p><p>What is known is that Murray’s partner, Matt, is not in the same industry as the Sydney-born actor.</p><p>However, it is unclear whether the couple is married or not, or how long they have been together. They have also made no public appearances as a pair thus far. Before his Emmy winning speech in September 2022, many people had no idea his partner’s name was Matt or that he was even dating. Furthermore, it is uncertain who Matt is and what he does.</p><p>Murray, in any case, has revealed that he and his boyfriend live in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a little hamlet on the Massachusetts coast. During the global epidemic of 2020, Bartlett moved in with his lover Matt. Previously, the Neighbors actor had lived in Brooklyn for 17 years. The couple relocated because they desired to live among nature and to form a community with their chosen family. The couple has yet to have children, but they have a border collie named Bo.</p><h2><span id=Murray_Bartlett8217s_decision_to_move_in_with_his_partner_proved_fortunate>Murray Bartlett’s decision to move in with his partner proved fortunate.</span></h2><p>In an interview, Bartlett admitted that the move he made with his boyfriend (relocating to Massachusetts) was a stroke of luck and that he should have done it sooner. Matt taped an audition for The White Lotus, the series that would earn him an Emmy, in his garage as a result.</p><p>Speaking of which, while accepting the Emmy in September 2022, Murray praised his boyfriend, Matt, for being his’sanctuary.’</p><p>Earlier in January 2023, in an interview with Mr. Porter, Bartlett, the John Curtin College graduate said that it was his partner, Matt, who predicted his Emmy victory. Murray stated that his partner had informed him before convincing him to move to Massachusetts that something “big is going to happen, and I don’t want us to be living in the city.”</p><h2><span id=Bartlett8217s_Previous_Relationships_Has_He_Ever_Had_A_Wife>Bartlett’s Previous Relationships; Has He Ever Had A Wife?</span></h2><p>Murray’s sexuality has been widely publicized for some years. Similarly to his current personal issues, the 51-year-old actor has rarely discussed his sexuality and its background. As a result, it’s unclear whether Murray ever had any straight allegiances, marriage or otherwise. It is also unknown whether or not he ever had a wife. He did, however, have a few male ex-partners in the past.</p><p>As a result, White Lotus isn’t the first HBO drama in which Murray landed a role while living with his girlfriend. When he was living in Cairo with his then-Egyptian partner, the five-foot-eleven-inch-tall actor earned the role of the Dom in Looking. Similarly to White Lotus, Murray taped himself from Cairo for Looking and was subsequently cast in HBO’s 2014 comedy series.</p><h2><span id=Murray_Bartlett_claims_that_he_and_his_boyfriend_have_opposing_temperaments>Murray Bartlett claims that he and his boyfriend have opposing temperaments.</span></h2><p>In a January 2023 conversation with Mr. Porter, Bartlett stated that he and his companion Matt had opposite temperaments. He is a very emotional person, according to the Guiding Light star, unlike his boyfriend.</p><p>Bartlett went on to say that he sometimes finds it exciting and irritating that his spouse does not ‘go into the snake pit with him.’</p><p>“One of the things I’ve found intriguing, if not a bit aggravating, is that he doesn’t dive into the snake pit with me. Initially, I was thinking, ‘Come on! ‘Please come in!’ It was also a little unsettling for me.”</p><p>stated the actor, who was born in 1987.</p><p>Bartlett, on the other hand, sees the distinctions as a benefit. According to the White Lotus actor, his cyclone of emotions and his partner’s mountain-like stillness balance each other out.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
