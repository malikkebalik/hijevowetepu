He quit his job in early 2016 to focus more on his YouTube work. He left Whitley Bay in January 2017 and moved to London.</li><li>Will’s YouTube channel blew up with a weird incident. He had been making videos since the age of 14 but did not have too many subscribers. During his 1st year at University, someone had tweeted him a link of YouTube video of a freestyle rap called Road Rage by a 13-year-old boy. Will was intrigued and decided to research further. He found out that there were plenty of other such child rappers and decided to edit a film about them. He published it with the title World’s Cringiest Children Ever Make Grime. Although the clip struggled for views initially, it soon started to go viral. This gave Will the idea to make a YouTube channel on the theme of mocking the weirdest stuff that one could find on the Internet.</li><li>His line of merchandise often features pictures of his dog Darcey and his tongue-in-cheek catchphrase subtoWillNE.</li><li>He had once received an official noise complaint letter from his neighbors at his London residence after a house party at his place.</li><li>In 2017, YouTube had changed its vetting policy to appease advertisers who were upset by the fact that some of their ads were being placed next to extremist videos or hate speech. The change in YouTube’s policies impacted the monetization of several medium-sized YouTubers such as Will. From March 2017 to April 2017, his monthly income dropped by 85%. He revealed in an interview that he had made that month’s rent by selling fidget spinners.</li><li>In August 2019, Will planned an elaborate prank to mock reality TV show Love Island‘s cast members’ willingness to sponsor anything. He started a website called Vassar Matchings and set up a fake company named Verify Today. He got in touch with the agents of the many of the cast members and several of them were ready to promote the company without doing any background check. Will even paid the agent of Sherif Lanre, a cast member, £1,000 which Sherif’s agent had to return after Will made his prank public and his fans hounded Sherif’s Instagram page asking him to return Will’s money.</li><p>Featured Image by WillNE / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jrCgpaSemnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
