With her height,&nbsp; a career in modeling is full of endless possibilities.</p><h2><strong>Destiny Odom Parents Were Never Married</strong></h2><p>Her parent, Lamar, and Liza gave birth to her and her siblings while still dating. They were together even before Lamar was drafted into the NBA in 1997. He was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the NBA draft as the fourth overall pick. Their relationship was never sealed in marriage.</p><p>Before they finally parted ways, Lamar and Liza dated on and off for 9 years. They ended their relationship for the last time in 2007. <a href=# rel=noopener>According to Liza,</a> she has learned to love her baby daddy from afar.</p><h2><strong>Her Father’s Marriage To Khloe Kardashian</strong></h2><p>Lamar Odom first met Khloe Kardashian of the reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashian in 2009 at the party of a friend.

Their marriage became a part of the show. Many people who did not know of Lamar’s NBA career suddenly started following him.</p><p>While the show was ongoing, Lamar and Khloe’s life was fueling some of the storylines. In 2011, after two years of marriage, they started their own show, Khloe and Lamar, a spin-off of her family’s Keeping Up With The Kardashians. His two children with ex-girlfriend were on the show as well.</p><p>Shortly after, Lamar’s career started going downhill. First, he was traded to the Dallas Mavericks by the Lakers. The hard time he was in his career was aired on the show.</p><h2><strong>Destiny Odom’s Father And Khloe Kardashian Divorce</strong></h2><p>Filming Khloe and Lamar put a strain on Lamar who was getting tired of filming while putting work into his career. He almost went off the show. Lamar parted ways with the Mavericks in 2012.</p><p>His growing depression led to drug use and other vices and in December 2013, Khloe filed for divorce.
