(AP)</p><p>“All in the Family” star Jean Stapleton, who brilliantly played the long suffering wife of working class bigot Archie Bunker in the 1970s hit TV sitcom, died at her Manhattan home, her family announced. She was 90.</p><p>She won three Emmy’s and two Golden Globes for her role as Edith, the devoted wife and perfect foil to Archie, played by the late Caroll O’Connor.</p><p>He often referred to her as “Dingbat” during his hysterically ignorant rants on issues like racism, homosexuality and the unpopular Vietnam War, which was ground-breaking for the time.</p><p>But during their more than 8 years on air, the audience knew Edith was a lot smarter and open-minded and would make him, if only temporarily, see the errors of his ways.</p><p>“The benign, compassionate presence she developed made my egregious churl bearable,” O’Connor wrote of Stapleton in his 1998 autobiography.</p><p>In the signature song, of the No. 1 CBS show, Edith and Archie would be at the piano wistfully singing about the good old days with Edith screeching the last line, “Those were the days!”</p><p>Among the cast members were Sally Struthers, who played their daughter Gloria, who was married to Michael “Meathead” Stivic, portrayed by Rob Reiner.</p><p>Stapleton was born in New York City on Jan. 19, 1923 and was the daughter of a billboard advertising salesman and an opera singer. She attended Hunter College.</p><p>She also appeared numerous times on Broadway and in Hollywood movies.</p><p>Stapleton is survived by her children, television producer Pamela Putch and film and television director John Putch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnR7j29maWlfn7Kiuoysq5qonJrBsLqMm5ylp6aasW6xw6KroWWSqrussdFmpqdlkaG5brXNZquhnV2brq61y7JknaGVqHqquoynnLBlqaS%2FrHnArWRyaF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
