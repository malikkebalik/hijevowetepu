Her debut album “Free Yourself” was certified Double Platinum, meaning more than two million copies sold, and garnered four Grammy nominations. Fantasia has been active in the entertainment industry since 2004.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Fantasia? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the outright size of her wealth is as much as $3 million, as of the data presented at the end of 2017. Film, television and music are the major sources of Fantasia’s modest fortune.</p><h3>Fantasia Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>To begin with, the girl was raised at High Point, by her parents, Joseph and Diane Barrino, both singers. Fantasy grew up in a poor environment, dangerous for a young girl like her, but was surrounded by music. In her autobiography, she states that she was sexually abused, and at age 16 she became pregnant with a little girl.</p><p>In 2004, Fantasy attended the Atlanta auditions of the famous “American Idol” TV program, and instantly impressed the judges with her talent, which also impressed the American public and led to her winning the third edition of the program, with more than one million votes ahead of second-ranked <a href=#>Diana DeGarmo</a>. Her interpretation of “Summertime” left her in tears, as she dedicated it to daughter Zion, and was named by Judges <a href=#>Randy Jackson</a> and <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> the best song ever seen in the history of all ‘Idol’ series.</p><p>After this triumph, the artist signed a contract with J Records. Her first album “Free Yourself” debuted in the top ten of the American charts, and sold over two million copies in total, earning four nominations for a Grammy Award. The debut song “The Believe” was released after the victory of “American Idol”, and reached first position on the chart, remaining for eleven weeks and becoming the best-selling single in the US in 2005. Fantasy was also named number one artist for Adult Urban Contemporary Format 2005, according to Billboard Magazine in 2005, and thanks to her album won numerous awards. Her second album “Fantasia” was released in 2006, and gained another three Grammy Awards nomination. At the end of 2007, Fantasia nominated at the American Music Awards as the best soul rhythm and blues artist. Since 2007, the singer has taken part in the Broadway production “The Purple Colour” in the role of the protagonist, Celie, for which Fantasy won the World Theatre Award, the most important award for a Broadway actor. Her net worth was certainly on the rise.</p><p>In 2010, the artist released her third album, “Back to Me”, which has had a great sales success in the US. The album entitled “Side Effects of You” was released in 2012, and in 2013, she performed live on five occasions with star tenor <a href=#>Andrea Bocelli</a>.</p><p>Fantasia received three more nominations for Grammy Awards in 2014, including the Best Urban Contemporary Album. In 2016, she released the single “No Time for It”, co-written and produced by Brian Kennedy, and the song “Sleeping with the One I Love”, written and produced by <a href=#>R. Kelly</a> – both songs are taken from the fifth studio album of the artist – “The Definition Of …”, which was released in the middle of 2016.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the singer, she has two children. She was in relationship with the basketball player Michael Clayton and the hip hop artists <a href=#>Young Dro</a>. In 2015, she married the businessman Kendall Taylor.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=29.611650485437><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 30, 1984</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>High Point, North Carolina, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.7&nbsp;m, 1.7&nbsp;m, 1.7&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Songwriter, Actress</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Andrews High School, High Point, North Carolina</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Kendall Taylor (m. 2015)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Zion Quari Barrino, Dallas Xavier Barrino</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Diane Barrino, Joseph Barrino</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Ricco Barrino, Ricco Barrino, Ricco Barrino</td></tr><tr readability=0.39024390243902><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/Fantasia</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/tasiasword</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.29787234042553><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://plus.google.com/+fantasiabarrino</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.375><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/team_fantasia</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm1568881</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.26229508196721><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fantasia-mn0000795053</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (2011), Theatre World Award (2007), NAACP Image Awards, Billboard Music Awards (2004)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Record Labels</td><td>J Records, 19 Records, RCA Records, Concord Records</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Albums</td><td>Free Yourself (2004), Fantasia (2006), Back to Me (2010)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Nominations</td><td>50th Annual Grammy Award - Best Female R&B Vocal Performance/Best Contemporary R&B Album/Best R&B Song (2007, Fantasia), North Carolina Music Hall of Fame (2014), 100 Greatest Women in Music (Nr 32 VH1 in 2012)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>Life Is Not a Fairytale: The Fantasia Barrino Story (2006, documentary), Kelly, Ruben & Fantasia: Home for Christmas (2004)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>TV Shows</td><td>American Idol (2004, 2013), Dancing with the Stars (2013), RuPaul's Drag Race (2011), So You Think You Can Dance (2013), The 68th Annual Tony Awards (2014)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Normally performs barefoot.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Her soulful voice</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=35.942393380013><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>Me and my father, we don't have a really good relationship.
