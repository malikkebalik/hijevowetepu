Might as well,” one person sarcastically tweeted.</p><p>“Way too short..how are you supposed to mark your ball in the green?” a second critic said.</p><p>“Thoughts? You’re whoring yourself for clicks,” a troll added.</p><p>“It’s not an ‘outfit’ nor are you amazed. You wore a costume, took a photo and posted it intending to cause a stir,” another added. “At first I thought you were just expressing yourself, but now I see you are just a publicity hound. It is disappointing to see a female athlete relegating her talent as secondary to her sexuality. These stunts are doing a disservice to yourself and to women everywhere struggling to be taken seriously.”</p><p>While some of the haters hit Spiranac with insults, others jumped to her defense.</p><p>“You are beautiful and classy.

It is too long,” a third joked.</p><p>“Sometimes a little “booty cleavage” adds a touch of excitement to the game, and we’re here for it! ⛳🍑😉,” a supporter cheered.</p><p>“The outfit is definitely making a statement! Fashion can spark interesting debates, and it’s great to see how diverse opinions can be,” another explained.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Some trolls called her skirt too short and claimed she was an attention seeker. <span class=credit>Instagram/ Paige Spiranac</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Spiranac denied having a breast augmentation after her boobs appeared to grow in size. <span class=credit>Instagram/ Paige Spiranac</span></figure><p>Spiranac has a history of advocating for her controversial style preferences.</p><p>In September, she <a href=#>wore a plunging sleeveless Polo golf top</a> that showcased her <a href=#>larger-than-usual bust.</a></p><p>“The shirt has a collar so it’s golf appropriate right?😏” she captioned the scorching photos.</p><p>Days prior, she <a href=#>wore a skintight jumpsuit </a>that unzipped to reveal her busty cleavage.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">She chalked up her growing breasts to weight gain and going on birth control. <span class=credit>Instagram/ Paige Spiranac</span></figure><p>In August, Spiranac<a href=#> denied rumors </a>that she had undergone breast augmentation surgery.

And so since I have gained more weight, they have gotten bigger,” she said, adding that&nbsp;“being on birth control” has also caused the fluctuation.</p><p>“There are a bunch of different changes — hormonal, weight gain — that make them change size,” Spiranac shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmpoaGlkZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COqZiin5ViwLG10ZqlmptdmbKnsc2dqmaan6TBunnCpZyarpGcsm68x6irqGWTlsK0tc2gZK6ooqSus3nOp2Ssp5Oerq15zJ6boplf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
