Ralph initially was held in the Story County Jail on an $11,000 cash-only bond, which he posted on Wednesday.</p><p>A non-contact order was initiated after the alleged assault. It was not immediately clear if Ralph had a lawyer who could comment on his behalf. According to the Associated Press, calls on Thursday to the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Iowa</a> public defender’s office in Story County were automatically disconnected.</p><p>According to the criminal complaint, Ralph’s accuser went to his Ames, Iowa, residence at about 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 3 at his request. An argument ensued, and Ralph allegedly became physical and injured his accuser. She requested Ralph contact emergency medical services, to which he refused.</p><p>Inside Ralph’s residence, the woman said she removed her pants to examine the injury and relieve some of her pain. At that time, she said Ralph initiated unwanted intercourse with the woman. Police described the accuser as having visible swelling on her back because of the assault, and Ralph admitted to shoving her into the stairs, according to the criminal complaint.</p><p>Ralph was entering his third season at Iowa State but had not played. He graduated from Chicago’s De La Salle High School.</p><p>(Photo: Michael C.
