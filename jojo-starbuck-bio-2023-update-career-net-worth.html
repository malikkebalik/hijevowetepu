At six years old, Starbuck moved to Southern California.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jojo-706.jpg><p>Starbuck was eight years old when she first took up skating. In the same way, <strong>Kenneth Shelley</strong> and Jojo paired up under the tutelage of <strong>John Nicks</strong> for a particular show.</p><p>Alicia first graced the ice ring with Nicks at the Arctic Blades FSC in 1961.</p><p>After making her way up as a prominent skater, Jojo started participating in professional tournaments.</p><p>These stints added to her confidence, and with a qualification to the 1968 Winter Olympics, the rest we know is history.</p><h2>Jojo Starbuck | Age, Height, & Body Measurements</h2><p>Born in 1951, Starbuck is a happy 72-year-old woman. There is nothing unfulfilling about the life she led.</p><p>If anything, people get inspiration and courage to go out more into the world.</p><p>On the other hand, the American stands at the height of 1.75 m and weighs a proper 190 lbs.</p><p>However, there is no information regarding her weight during her active career days. But, we can deduce that a figure skater needs a flexible and agile body.</p><p>As we immerse ourselves in her performance, we get to know that figure skating is a daunting task.</p><p>There is seldom room for error. A minute mistake might result in a career-ending injury. As a result, a skater needed to be strong physically while still owning a slimmer body.</p><h2>Jojo Starbuck | Career | Figure Skating</h2><p>Jojo and her skating partner Kenneth Shelley became the youngest pair to ever feature at the Olympics, representing the U.S. As children, the two loved skating together. Unfortunately, the ice rink in their hometown closed.</p><p>However, there was hope for their passion in Iceland. Jojo garnered an affinity towards ice dancing. With no background on the form, the coach dropped her as a student, and that’s where John Nicks came in.</p><p>Thus, Shelley and Jojo formed an inseparable partnership since then, having done it as kids and continuing even as adults. Similarly, the two were the stars of the Ice Capades while also showing professional involvement.</p><p>Alicia appeared as an actor during her skating career. For instance, movies like Snow Queen, The Cutting Edge, and Beauty and the Beast: A Concert on Ice featured the blonde skater.</p><p>Moreover, Shelley and Starbuck were such a successful duo that they grabbed the United States Pair’s Champions title from 1970 to 1972.</p><h3>Furthermore,</h3><p>The duo stunned the crowd at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. Eventually, the skating duo would be inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jojo-701.jpg><p>Jojo, as a performer, was utterly flawless. Figure skating is already an appealing sport and adds Starbuck’s charisma to it, and you will have a perfect mix. Further, Kenneth and Jo’s performance were something from a wonderland.</p><p>Despite not succeeding in many competitions, the skating duo seldom made errors.</p><p>Yes, there were better skaters than Kenneth and Starbuck, but we can not undermine that the Californians made their native America proud on the international stage.</p><p>On the other hand, upon retirement, Alicia had to devote part of her time to her children. As a result, the American Hall of Famer became a skating instructor mostly during the day hours.</p><p>Likewise, the 72-year-old imparts the same core values she grew up with to the younger generations. During weekdays, Jojo used to conduct class at the Rockefeller Center’s ice rink.</p><p>Similarly, Starbuck avidly spends her time as an instructor, wherein stay-at-home mothers come to the classes once a week to engage in something other than household chores.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, the blonde skating legend also undertook the role of Artistic Director for the Ice Capades.</p><p>The organization’s main motive is to revitalize the joy and interest and inculcate a passion for America’s beloved sport.</p><h3>Career Achievements And Highlights</h3><p>In the World Championships,</p><ul><li>Bronze Medal in 1971 Lyon</li><li>Bronze Medal in 1972 Calgary</li></ul><p>In the North American Championships,</p><ul><li>Silver Medal in 1969 Oakland</li><li>Gold Medal in 1971 Peterborough</li></ul><h2>Jojo Starbuck | Net Worth, Income & Endorsements</h2><p>Though there are no exact numbers, the former skater expectedly amassed a net worth between $500k – $1 million in her career. Additionally, the 72-year-old pockets a yearly <strong>$200k</strong> in remunerations.</p><p>Apart from her skating career, Jojo also committed as an actress. Though she never intended to go large, Starbuck’s films generated a mouth-watering revenue over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jojo-702.jpg><p>In particular, Alicia’s movie New York Stories garnered a whopping <strong>$10.7 million</strong>. The 1992 movie The Cutting Edge also made <strong>$25.1 million</strong> at the box office.</p><p>Accordingly, the TV movie Beauty and&nbsp;the Beast: A Concert on Ice enjoyed considerable success, although the exact amount of revenue remains in the dark.</p><p>Jojo’s husband is an architect who makes $1 million annually, with a base salary of <strong>$108k</strong>.</p><p>So, assumably, Starbuck and her family enjoy an exquisite life with all the fortune collected throughout her working years.</p><h2>Jojo Starbuck Quotes</h2><ul><li>You have to stay the course and give yourself time to become great.</li><li>Don’t be impressed by money, followers, degrees, and titles.

On the contrary, Starbuck previously married <strong>Terry Bradshaw,</strong> a famous NFL quarterback.</p><p>Initially, it was sports that united the two. After meeting in 1974, Bradshaw and Starbucks tied the knot in 1976.</p><p>While this may be true, the couple had a fallout, and the marriage ended in bitterness. Jojo is now a happy woman with a loving husband, Jeff.</p><h2>2022 Update&nbsp;</h2><p>The last update she gave about her life was posting about the Ice Dance International Show: Grace – The Power of Dance on Ice on her Instagram.</p><p>The tour ran from September 17 – October 9, 2022, featuring two-time U.S. Champion Alissa Czisny and U.S. Open Champions Kseniya Ponomaryova and Collin Brubaker.</p><p>She is still passionate about her favorite sport and went to support at the Richard J.
