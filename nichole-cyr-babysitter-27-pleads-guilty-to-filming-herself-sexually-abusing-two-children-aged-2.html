The Department of Justice announced that 27-year-old Nichole Cyr is scheduled for sentencing on December 20, for two counts of <a href=# rel>sexual exploitation</a> of children. She was arrested in July 2020 after child sexual abuse material, including photos and videos, was found on cellphones owned by her, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Rachael Rollins’ office</a>. Investigators found material involving two victims, a two-year-old and a seven-year-old. Cyr allegedly abused the 2-year-old multiple times, according to Rollins. Officials said Cyr knew both victims, and she babysat them more than once.</p><p>Police also found that Cyr shared those materials with another person named Paul Weddington. He was sentenced in June to 12 years in prison and five years of supervised release for one count of receiving <a href=# rel>child pornography</a>, reported <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Boston.com</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Sick BABYSITTER killed crying baby by violently shaking her till she turned 'limp and blue'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Lizzie Norton: Babysitter and kids' dad's dance on video causes outrage as he touches her breasts</a></p><p>“Today, Ms. Cyr admitted to some of the most egregious conduct that my office prosecutes,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Law & Crime</a> quoted Rollins as saying. “She sexually victimized two children in her life – one that was only a toddler – captured the <a href=# rel>abuse on camera</a>, and then shared the horrific material. Ms. Cyr took advantage of these young, innocent children entrusted to her care. For that, this predator is now a convicted felon facing a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in federal prison. My office will continue to use every tool in our arsenal to investigate and prosecute those who prey on and sexualize our children.”</p><p>“The production of child sexual abuse material immortalizes the horrific act of sexually abusing a child through photos and video, making it even more difficult for survivors to heal from the trauma of abuse,” said Matthew B. Millhollin, Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New England. “Today’s plea ensures Cyr will face significant time behind bars for her actions. The protection of children is one of our greatest and most solemn duties as a law enforcement agency. HSI will continue in our mission to investigate predators like Cyr and bring them to justice before they can do more harm.”&nbsp;</p><p>Cyr faces a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 30 years in prison.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel>MEAWW&nbsp;</a>previously reported that a babysitter was charged with murder as a boy she was looking after died, according to the Alcorn County Sheriff’s Department. Makallie Durham, 23, was babysitting two children in Corinth, Mississippi on September 13, when paramedics responded to a call about an unresponsive two-year-old boy, the sheriff’s office said. The local authorities reached the place just after 9 pm on that day. The first responders found the boy with multiple bruises and marks on his body when they arrived. He was immediately transported by ambulance to Magnolia Regional Hospital. An 11-month-old infant girl was also found suffering from various unidentified injuries. She was also later transported to the same hospital but later both of them were shifted to Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoppmYtbC4xGaasqpdl66jxdKiq62domK9rbHAnapmn6WeubXFjK2mZquVrcKiuMuyZJqapai2r7OMra6oZZOdtq2w0Z6lZp6RobluvsivnKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
