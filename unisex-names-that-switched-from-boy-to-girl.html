Unisex names are rarely perfectly gender-balanced. They’re usually given more to one gender or the other, and the balance changes over time.
Sometimes it just takes one famous namesake to tip the name over to the opposite sex."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But rewind 100 years and they were used mainly — or even exclusively — for boys. So were a lot of other names that are now more female.</p><p><a href=#><u>Unisex names</u></a> are rarely perfectly gender-balanced. They’re usually given more to one gender or the other, and the balance changes over time.</p><p>Sometimes it just takes one famous namesake to tip the name over to the opposite sex. In the 1940s, Hollywood star <b>Lauren </b>Bacall (real name Betty Joan Perske) had an astronomical impact on a rare-but-mostly-male name. More recent influencers turning <a href=#><u>boy names</u></a> into girl names include <b>Reese </b>Witherspoon, <b>Sutton </b>Foster, and <b>Madison</b> the mermaid (played by Daryl Hannah) in <i>Splash</i>.</p><p>Meanwhile, some names switch gender because of a gradual change in fashionable sounds. <b>Emery</b>, and later <b>Avery</b>, became more viable as <a href=#><u>girl names</u></a> with the rise in popularity of Emily, Emma, and Ava.</p><p>Here, we take a look at names that were <b>once 100% male, but are now mainly female</b>, using the USA’s <a href=#><u>most popular baby names 2022</u></a>.</p><h3>Names Now All Female</h3><p>These names used to be all male, but are now 100% female. They were given to 0-4 boys in 2022, so they aren’t on the charts. Most are somewhat dated for girls, too:</p><p>Some names on this list are still unisex in use, like <b>Emerson </b>and <b>Finley</b>, while others are now almost exclusively given to girls, like <b>Addison </b>and <b>Hadley</b>. Most names here are surnames and place names, a style that is particularly gender-fluid.</p><p>Here, some of the most <a href=#><u>popular girl names</u></a> that were once 100% male, along with the year they moved permanently to a girl majority.</p><h2>Unisex Names That Changed from Boy to Girl</h2><h4>A to D</h4><p><b>Addison</b>: 98% female in 2022.
