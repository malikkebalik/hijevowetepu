At the centerpiece is a green serpent gazing over a bowl of piping hot gumbo.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Meanwhile, the caption displaying a shrimp emoji — in place of the “g” in gumbo — and several mushroom emojis, highlights what fans can expect from the release, a roster chockfull of new food-inspired lyricism — with songs like&nbsp; “Duck Meat,” “Pancake,” and “Portabella,” gracing the list.</p><p>Best known for his eerie mixtape series&nbsp;<i>Slimeball</i>&nbsp;(2016),&nbsp;<i>Slimeball 2</i>&nbsp;(2017), and&nbsp;<i>Slimeball 3</i> (2018), as well as “Since When” (2018) a collaborative effort with 21 Savage, the rapper has since shown he’s got quite the appreciation for snacks. In 2017, Nudy dropped his album&nbsp;Nudy Land where song names included “Loaded Baked Potato” and “Barbecue,” giving listeners their first glimpse into his unique song titling ability.</p><p>And, again in 2022, Nudy released a mixtape titled <a class=underline-link href=#>EA Monster</a>, which also featured tracks boasting food-inspired names like “KitKat” and “Lunch Meat,” scoring a 3.8 out of 5 from HipHopDX writer Ben Brutocao.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/12/21-savage-gifts-young-nudy-gold-rolex-watch-birthday-250x142.jpg alt="21 Savage Gifts Young Nudy Gold Rolex Watch For His Birthday: 'You Snapped!'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>21 Savage Gifts Young Nudy Gold Rolex Watch For His Birthday: 'You Snapped!'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 19, 2022</p></a><p>“Young Nudy proves he has a formidable knack for innovating within his genre. If Gucci Mane is Larry McMurtry, Nudy is Cormac McCarthy, able to conjure the wicked macabre while linking his work by unseen threads to an established and familiar genre. Without compromising “realness,” he has emerged as an artistic breath of fresh air in a rap genre that too often feels like a popularity contest.&nbsp;EA Monster effectively blends his street-horror sagas, wistful humor and earth-cratering beats into a tour-de-force of sinister anthems,” Brutocao writes.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Following the news of the release, fans took to social media where they shared their enthusiasm. “Young Nudy fans love his food title songs the most, so he’s releasing a whole project based on it. Don’t you love when artists give in to what the fans actually want? [crying emoji] [raised hands emoji],” wrote one user. “whats ur favorite young nudy song ? mine prolly 80/20 beef patty on a sesame bun with a side of fries and mayo, bbq, spicy mustard n ketchup mixed together,” added a second user, poking fun at Nudy’s song titles.</p><p>Up next, Nudy has teamed up with Rolling Loud for a North American tour. The 29-date run begins March 1 in San Diego and concludes on April 20 for a homecoming show in Atlanta at the Coca-Cola Roxy. The tour will be Nudy’s first since releasing <i>EA Monster</i> last fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miwqK2enHqvwcOyZGtpXaiut63GnmSknalitK27wqRkn6efmXqqutKpoKudlGKura7Upg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
