He was driving a pickup truck and, for reasons still under investigation, failed to stop at the end of the track. Instead, he continued into a gravel safety pit at a high rate of speed.</p><p>Despite the vehicle coming to a stop against a sand mound in the pit, Ruggiero sustained severe injuries that tragically proved fatal. It is important to note that he was taking safety precautions, wearing a helmet and secured in the vehicle with a five-point harness.</p><p>The Westmoreland County Coroner, Tim Carson, arrived at the scene and pronounced Ruggiero deceased. While the details surrounding the accident are still being examined, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks and dangers associated with motorsport.</p><p>During this trying time, our thoughts and prayers are with Ronnie John Ruggiero’s family and loved ones as they navigate the pain of this loss. The motorsport community mourns the passing of a fellow enthusiast, and we share in the collective grief of his loved ones. May he rest in peace, and may his memory be a source of strength and solace to those who cherished him.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwvs6npaKdXafCqLPInqmoZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwZqGeYrmwwsinnmallaK8s8WMqJ1mqp%2Bju6qxjKusoJ%2BZmr%2Bwew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
