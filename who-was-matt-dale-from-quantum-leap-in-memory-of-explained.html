Here’s <a href=# rel=noopener>everything there is to know about Matt Dale</a>.</p><p>A reboot of the hit 1989 series of the same name, Quantum Leap is NBC’s popular sci-fi series. The show first premiere in 2022 and stars Raymond Lee as the new lead character Dr. Ben Song, as well as Caitlin Bassett, Mason Alexander Park, Nanrisa Lee and Ernie Hudson. It centers on Ben, a physicist who finds himself trapped in the past, “leaping” into the lives of different people, sorting out their problems and changing history in hopes of getting back to his own life in the present.</p><p>The show is currently on it’s second season and the 11th episode proved to be one of the most dramatic episodes yet. During the episode, titled “The Outsider,” Herbert “Magic” Williams (Hudson) resigned as the head of Project Quantum Leap in a shocking twist. Off-screen, the show lost one of their own as well; the episode concluded with a dedication to “our friend” Matt Dale. So, who is Matt Dale and how is he connected to the show?

Matt Dale was an accomplished author and a co-host of the Quantum Leap Podcast. The podcast recaps episodes of the show every week and features interviews with the creators, cast and crew. He also wrote Beyond the Mirror Image, a three-volume book series that takes a detailed, exhaustive look back at the original series.</p><p>Dale’s podcast co-hosts announced his passing in early January 2024, revealing that he died on Christmas Day after suffering a heart attack. “All of us here on the QLP team are heartbroken, and the podcast is going on a temporary hiatus as we regroup and take time to heal,” they wrote on the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">podcast’s website</a>. “The outpouring of love and support from the Quantum Leap fan commuinty — as well as from the cast and crew of Quantum Leap — has been nothing short of astonishing. And as his longtime friends and colleagues, Albie, Allison, Hayden and I can’t thank you enough for your kind words, and for helping honor Matt’s memory and his considerable legacy in the Quantum Leap community.”</p><p>Deborah Pratt, executive producer of the revived show, also dedicated a tribute to Dale. “He was a dear friend and a long time, ultimate Quantum Leap&nbsp;fan. Matt wrote&nbsp;Beyond the Mirror Image: The Observers guide to Quantum Leap. He was head of the&nbsp;Quantum Leap&nbsp;Podcast and author of the best books on the original&nbsp;Quantum Leap&nbsp;series and soon to come book 3, based on the new&nbsp;Quantum Leap series,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-entity-href=https://www.instagram.com/deborahmpratt/p/C18uDfar3bv/ data-entity-title=https://www.instagram.com/deborahmpratt/p/C18uDfar3bv/ data-once=mparticle-click-element>wrote on Instagram</a>. “We lost him on Christmas Day. He left his partner Sharon and his son 7-year-old Zack behind. Matt was 43. There’s an ancient Egyptian saying, ‘We died twice in this life. Once when we pass from our physical bodies, and a second time when people stop saying our name.’ Help me keep the legend. In remembrance.”</p><p>Pratt included a link to a GoFundMe fundraiser benefitting Dale’s wife and son as well.
