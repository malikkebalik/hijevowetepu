So, our mission here in Washington, DC, didn’t go as planned, but it’s not going to stop us.”</p><p>Rose <a href=#>told The Post on Monday</a> that the stunt was designed to boost subscriptions to ShagMag so the magazine could raise money for breast cancer awareness.</p><p>“It wasn’t just for fun, it was for a really good cause,” Summer says in the video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7kGlma3Ffq7alsc5mnqido2KvprTIp5tmrJiaerSvxKecrGWfm3qrwcuimGaqn6iytHnWqKmlnF2osrO1xKxkn6SRqLWqusZmqq2tnql8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
