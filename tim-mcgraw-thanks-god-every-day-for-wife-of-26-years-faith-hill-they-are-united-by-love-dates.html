However, they did not start dating immediately as they were in different relationships then.</p><p class=Zg>They <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/How-Did-Tim-McGraw-Faith-Hill-Meet-43336520>first met</a> in 1994 at the New Faces Show in Nashville, Tennessee. Hill had just divorced her ex-husband, Daniel Hill, and McGraw was dating Kristine Donahue.</p><p class=Zg>Although their initial meeting was brief, Hill and McGraw got to know each other better when they went on tour together in 1996. By then, McGraw was single after his split from Donahue, while Hill was engaged to record producer Scott Hendricks.</p><p class=Zg>However, as they sang together on stage every night, they couldn't ignore the chemistry between them. Eventually, after one of their shows, McGraw invited Hill into his dressing room, where they shared their first kiss.</p><p class=Zg>McGraw and Hill began dating after Hill called off her engagement to Hendricks. McGraw had proposed to her several times, but she always refused. She told him she did not wish to be associated with another country singer.</p><p class=Zg>Undeterred and determined to persuade her, McGraw <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/faith-hill-and-tim-mcgraws-complete-relationship-timeline/>proposed</a> again at a country music festival where he was performing. He got down on one knee in a trailer house set up for the music festival and proposed to her.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Faith Hill and her husband Tim McGraw at the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards at T-Mobile Arena on April 2, 2017, in Las Vegas, Nevada | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Hill was shocked by the proposal and asked if he was serious. McGraw had to go on stage for his performance before he received a response, and when he returned, she had written her response in lipstick on a mirror, which read, "Yes! I'm gonna be your wife."</p><p class=Zg>The couple finally tied the knot in October 1996. They kept the mirror as a reminder of the special day, and McGraw still regards it as the best day of his life. The pair have been happily married for over two decades now.</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>How Faith Helped Her Husband Change</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>Over time, Hill and McGraw's relationship became stronger and stronger. Even though it started unexpectedly, their love for each other never faded. They were happiest in the late 1990s when they began their own family.</p><p class=Zg>At the 24th annual American Music Awards, which took place in January 1997, the couple walked the red carpet together, and Faith proudly showed off her growing bump.</p><p class=Zg>Hill and her husband's happiness was just getting started. In May of that year, they became parents for the first time when they <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/faith-hill-and-tim-mcgraws-complete-relationship-timeline/>welcomed</a> their daughter, Grace.</p><p class=Zg>The happy duo expanded their family once again with the arrival of their second daughter, Maggie, in August 1998.

He used it to <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/health/tim-mcgraw-health-journey-after-going-sober/>fight his shyness</a> and gain confidence whenever he stepped out on stage.</p><p class=Zg>He revealed that his drinking had developed into a consistent behavior. Thankfully, with Hill's prompt action, he was able to beat his alcohol addiction and break free from his old ways.</p><p class=Zg>McGraw said when his wife told him his drinking had gone too far, it was a wake-up call for him. He realized that if he didn't change, he would lose everything important to him—his family and his career.</p><p class=Zg>As his daughters grew older, McGraw realized they had noticed his drinking habits. This was another turning point for him, and he knew he had to make a change for the sake of his family.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, along with their daughters Gracie, Audrey, and Maggie McGraw, at Time 100 Gala's Time 100 Most Influential People In The World at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 21, 2015, in New York City | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>McGraw's friends influenced his change, but his three daughters motivated him to break free from his old habits and become a new version of himself, so he quit drinking.
