The best action thriller of the year is led by a man who is over sixty. <strong>The Old Man</strong> on FX quickly became the most-watched cable series premiere of the year and FX’s most-watched show on Hulu, proving that age is more important than beauty. FX quickly (and rightly) decided to give it a Season 2 renewal because it was one of the best new shows of the year. Jeff Bridges plays Dan Chase, a former CIA agent who has to come out of hiding when an old enemy who wants to get even with him finds him. Harold Harper, an FBI Assistant Director played by John Lithgow, is an old friend of Dan’s who is in charge of trying to catch him. The Old Man is a classic thriller with a lot of action and twists that have us looking forward to Season 2. But what will Season 2 of The Old Man be about? Who is coming back? When will the dogs return? Here’s what we know about Season 2 of The Old Man. <strong>Read More:</strong><ul><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>Too Hot to Handle Season 4 Release Date Status, Renewed Confirmation & Everything You Need To Know</a></li><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>Siren Season 4: Officially Cancelled, Details You Need to Know Right Now!</a></li></ul><h2>The Old Man Season 2 Renewed At FX</h2><p>Season 2 of The Old Man has been officially renewed for 2023</p><h2>The Old Man Season 2 Release Date</h2><p>There is no set date for a second season, but we hope the show will keep coming out once a year.

Or will anything else unite Chase and Harper instead of Angela’s safety? We currently only know that we can anticipate another crazy trip.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/the-old-man.jpg alt="the old man" width=1600 height=900 sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>We couldn’t be more excited to start the next part of this journey,” said executive producers Jonathan E. Steinberg, Warren Littlefield, and Dan Shotz in a statement following the series’ renewal for Season 2. The only thing we can think of to thank our friends at FX and 20th Television for their unrelenting patience, faith, and support in helping us finish Season 1 is to go deliver a Season 2 that sets the bar even higher.</p><h2>Where To Watch The Old Man Season 2?</h2><p>You Can Watch The Old Man Season 2 on <a href=# rel=noopener>Hulu</a>.</p><h2>The Old Man Season 2 Trailer Update</h2><p>Stay Tuned.
