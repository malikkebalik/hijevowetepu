She’s a bit concerned, especially when he’s evasive about when he’s going to be free. Off the phone, Chad walks forlornly over to Abigail’s grave.</p><p>He places flowers on it and sits down to talk to her. He still can’t believe it’s been a year since her death. He still thinks about her and the baby they were thinking of having all the time. Sometimes it feels like he never lost her… And suddenly he hears a twig snapping nearby! “Abby?” Instead, it’s Julie, with flowers of her own.</p><p>Julie says Abby is always watching over him and he wonders how she feels about him and Stephanie. Julie’s sure it would be good things. She understands his torn feelings, but she’s sure Abigail would want him to make room in his heart for someone else and be happy.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-1441-e1686592867289.jpg alt="Days, Chad greeting Julie in the cemetery" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>They talk about his “vision” of Abigail after Clyde was caught. Whether it was real or not, Julie says, Abby would want him to get on with his life. He still feels guilty, but Julie tells him he deserves happiness. Maybe wearing the wedding ring is holding him back a little? Maybe… She pushes him to forgive himself. Let go of his survivor’s guilt. Move on. She leaves and he takes off the wedding ring, vowing to love Abby forever.</p><p>Stephanie opens the door to Alex, who stopped by to give her the good news that he’s got a job. He turned Maggie’s offer to rehire him down… and took Brady up on his offer. Steph’s taken aback. “You took a job with the competition? How does Maggie feel about that?”</p><p>He doesn’t care about her or Uncle Victor, but Stephanie’s not sure. He just wanted to tell her the good news but should run before Chad gets back. “Don’t want to piss off Chad.” Stephanie’s pretty sure he’s with Abigail today. Alex points out that Chad still wears his wedding ring. No kidding. Stephanie understands it, though. She’s just so chill “about living in Abigail’s shadow.” But hey, he hopes Chad’s OK.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/JPI_Episode14614_0002009455-e1686592931817.jpg alt="Days Alex and Abigail talking on her couch" width=1024 height=599 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Leo answers the door at his and Gwen’s room, horrified to see Dimitri. He tries playing dumb, but Dimitri says the two of them have unfinished business — and Leo’s not going anywhere until it’s settled. He lets himself into the room and refreshes Leo’s memory about the jewels he stole in the Alamainian Peacock. He grabs Leo by the shirt and tells him he’s going to pay. Leo calls for help and Gwen rushes out to rescue him, telling Dimitri to back off of her best friend or he’s going back to prison.</p><p>Dimitri ponders it, then gets a text from Mommie Dearest reminding him to make headway with Gwen. He’ll play nice. Leo runs out before Dimitri can change his mind. Gwen knows Leo’s a lot, “but he has a good heart, and he makes me laugh.” She wants to know if he’s still up for an interview. He wants to do it in her room — for the intimacy.</p><p>She wants to keep things professional, and he just thinks it would be quieter in the room. Fine. He doesn’t stop pouring on the charm and buys them lunch. Gwen looks a bit uncertain but asks about the “real Dimitri von Leuschner.”</p><p>He was raised by his mom, who he loves dearly… but who can be needy. He often felt like he was the adult. His father was Oscar von Leuschner. He was never around much, and when he was, he was cold. “He may as well have been absent from my life altogether.” Dimitri gets emotional, admitting the wealth didn’t make up for the lack of unconditional love.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-1453-e1686592991873.jpg alt="Days Gwen and Dimitri having lunch and interviewing" width=1024 height=599 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Days has a Stefano problem</a></p><p>He thinks that the “me against the world” mentality it left him with drove his questionable choices. All he wants is to be loved. Gwen gets it. Is there anyone he fancies right now? No. There was, but he kept getting hurt, so he walked away. He thinks Gwen might know what that feels like. He overheard her talking about Xander with Kristen. They have “a connection. Of sorts.” She agrees.</p><p>Over at the Spectator, Chloe delivers an impressive ad buy to Xander, who knew she’d be great at the new job. Chloe’s enjoying the stress-free day without Gwen around. Xander says she’s off to interview Dimitri, then suggests his new employee take a break to spend more time together. He can’t stop thinking about their kiss, but Maggie bursts in before he can add another one. She offers him Alex’s former job.</p><p>Xander wonders what Victor would think and Maggie says it’s not up to him. It’s up to Xander. He then wonders how Sarah would feel, but Maggie says that’s not a big deal, plus, she hopes her daughter will forgive him yet. Well, he’s not ready to step away from the paper yet, things have improved at the job lately. Maggie looks at Chloe. “Oh. Well.” He should at least think about it, then rushes out.</p><p>Alone, he admits to Chloe that part of him would love to go back and rub it in Victor’s face. But he’s not taking the job. He wants to work with Chloe. And he can’t abandon her with Gwen. They lean in to kiss — as Leo arrives to grab his paycheck. Xander leaves and Chloe asks Leo not to mention it to Gwen. Whatever, she’s having lunch with a hunk right now, anyway.</p><p>Leo then dangles Sarah in front of Chloe and warns her that Gwen always played second fiddle to her.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/JPI_Episode14615_0002012606-e1686593087110.jpg alt="Days Chloe looking ticked off in the Spectator" width=1024 height=599 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Bonnie, meanwhile, is on the phone, reassuring Sarah that she won’t spill the beans. Justin walks in to greet her and wants to know all about Chicago. Bonnie shows him photos, then he asks about Sarah. He figures Rex must have mentioned her and Bonnie splutters for a bit before admitting she saw her. She gets hot and grabs some water. Justin guesses something’s wrong. She’s acting strange.</p><p>He wants to know what’s going on. She notes that he’s her husband… but also an attorney. She gives him a dollar and tells him he’s her attorney now, so they’ve got attorney/client privilege. “Sarah’s pregnant with Xander’s baby!”</p><p>Bonnie explains what happened and Justin gets why Sarah stayed quiet, but isn’t sure why Bonnie knows. Then as she rehashes how the pregnancy secret needs to stay secret, Maggie arrives to overheard and ask, “Who’s pregnant?” Bonnie claims Mimi and Maggie’s thrilled. But she’d love to be a grandmother again.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-1458-e1686593152958.jpg alt="Days' Justin looking annoyed at Bonnie" width=1024 height=597 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>What’s Harris’ future in Salem?</a></p><p>In the show’s final moments, Chad arrives at Stephanie’s to apologize and tell her where he was. She figured, and he doesn’t owe her an apology. The meeting went well, she says, then as he pulls his work out, she notices his wedding ring is gone with a grateful smile.</p><p>Bonnie wonders if Maggie bought it and blames Justin for ruining her lying skills. It might not matter, he assures his wife. Sarah has to come clean eventually. He leaves and tells Bonnie to keep her mouth shut. He’s just got to stay away from Xander… right as he walks in!</p><p>Next on Days of Our Lives: <a href=# rel=noopener>Bonnie tries her hardest to keep Xander in the dark</a>, and Gabi thinks it’s time Stefan and EJ united against a larger threat.</p><p><i>Days of Our Lives</i> now exclusively airs on Peacock.
