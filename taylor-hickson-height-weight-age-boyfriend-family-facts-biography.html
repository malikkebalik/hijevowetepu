By the time she was 12, she had already started performing in talent shows across British Columbia alongside her father.</li><li>She completed high school a whole year earlier in 2014, in order to pursue her passion for music.</li><li>It was a relative of hers who convinced her to attend an audition for an acting agency that belonged to one of her aunt’s friends. She was 16 years old at the time and was signed on to their roster that very same day.</li><li>Taylor had started an eponymous YouTube channel on January 3, 2011, to which she would upload music cover videos.</li><li>One of the earliest posts that she uploaded to her Instagram account was on July 15, 2015.</li><li>She made her debut feature film appearance in&nbsp;Blackway in 2015.</li><li>In 2016, Taylor was cast in a minor role alongside the likes of actor <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Ryan Reynolds</a> and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Morena Baccarin</a> in Deadpool.</li><li>Taylor succumbed to a horrible accident on the set of Ghostland after she was told by director Pascal Laugier to hit her fists against a glass panel and that it was safe to do so. However, in a turn of events, the glass shattered and Taylor lost her balance, falling on the shards of glass that led to her cutting the left side of her face. According to reports, Hickson had to get 70 stitches in total and was left a permanent scar. She then underwent laser and silicone treatments to further subdue the appearance of the scar. Ironically, the poster art of the film also shows a young woman in a broken and slashed image.</li><p>Featured Image By Taylor Hickson / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jq2YsqSfp3qptcKkqqimXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
