His family also claimed his innocence on Friday (March 25), with his mother Jamie King and brother YNW Bslime going on the record to say they’re confident Melly will be home in May.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>During an appearance on the We In Miami podcast, King made the claim after host Slim Stunta asked when the “Mixed Personalities” spitter could possibly return home.
