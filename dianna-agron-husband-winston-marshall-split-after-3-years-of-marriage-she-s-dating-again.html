The former couple’s quiet nuptials was much like their engagement — there was little fanfare as the two got engaged over the holidays in 2015.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dianna-agron-winston-marshall-mega-embed2.jpg>Prior to their engagement, the reported exes sparked romance rumors when they were spotted holding hands in July 2015. The two were seen spending time together in Paris, and a source shared with Us that Dianna had actually been a huge fan of Mumford & Sons for quite some time. After their sighting, they chose to keep the details about their relationship close to their hearts, rarely speaking about it in the press.<p id=content-paragraph-5>Before their marriage, Dianna was reportedly involved with her I Am Number Four co-star&nbsp;<strong>Alex Pettyfer&nbsp;</strong>from August 2010 to February 2011. Once their relationship came to an end, she dated Marvel Cinematic Universe star&nbsp;<strong>Sebastian Stan</strong> between May-December 2011. Dianna had two other serious relationships before meeting Winston. The Mumford & Sons bandmate, however, was linked to expectant first-time mom and singer <strong>Katy Perry</strong> for a time in March 2015, before her romance with now-fiancé&nbsp;<strong>Orlando Bloom</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dianna-agron-winston-marshall-mega-embed.jpg>Dianna and Winston become one of the latest couples to go their separate ways.
