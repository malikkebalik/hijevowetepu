Some of the shows she has appeared on throughout her career include&nbsp;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Empire, Making the Cut, Ready To Wear,&nbsp;and more. In more recent years, however, the 53-year-old has embraced a more meaningful title: being a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>proud mother</a>. Amid the exciting news that the brunette beauty has welcomed her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>second child</a> on Jun. 29, 2023, here is everything to know about Naomi’s kids and what she’s said about motherhood!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Naomi-Campbell-kids-ss-embed-1.jpg><h2>Naomi Campbell’s Daughter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Naomi-Campbell-kids-spl-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Naomi embraced motherhood later on in life, at the age of 50. In May 2021, the UK native took to Instagram to surprise her millions of fans and announce that she had welcomed her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first child</a> – a daughter. At the time, she shared a since-deleted photo of her holding her little one’s feet. “A beautiful little blessing has chosen me to be her mother,” the then 50-year-old wrote in the caption. “So honoured to have this gentle soul in my life. There are no words to describe the lifelong bond that I now share with you, my angel. There is no greater love.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Following the arrival of her daughter, 2, (whose name is not publicly known) the runway legend appeared on the cover of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue UK&nbsp;</a>with her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter in her arms</a> for the Feb. 2022 issue. At the time, the chic momma noted that her daughter, then nine mos., loves to be a jet-setter like Naomi. “I’m lucky my little one loves to travel like me – no whimpering taking off or landing,” she explained. “She’s a good girl: she sleeps very well, she hardly ever cries and I’m told she’s very alert for her age. She’s just started waving, which is fun. She laughs a lot. She’s almost talking.” The starlet is famously private about the details around her two-year-old’s birth, however she did reveal that, “She wasn’t adopted – she’s my child.”</p><h2>Naomi Campbell’s Son</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Naomi-Campbell-kids-ig-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Just two years after Naomi became a mother for the first time in her life, she decided to expand her family once more. On Jun. 29, 2023, she took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to announce the arrival of her son. “My little darling, know that you are cherished beyond measure and surrounded by love from the moment you graced us with your presence. A True Gift from God, blessed !

She told&nbsp;Vogue UK in 2022 that, having a child is the “biggest blessing” of her life. “I can count on one hand the number of people who knew that I was having her,” she said of announcing her first child’s arrival. “But she is the biggest blessing I could ever imagine. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Although the fashionista’s children came as a surprise to many, in her heart, Naomi always knew this was her destiny. “I always knew that one day I would be a mother, but it’s the biggest joy I could ever imagine.

I know that in relationships I have to compromise.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>She was previously engaged to U2 member <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Adam Clayton</strong></a> in 1993 and businessman <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Flavio Briatore</strong></a> before their breakup in 2002, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>.
